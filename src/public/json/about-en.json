  "column1Copy":"World Humanitarian Day falls on 19 August, the day when, in 2003, 22 aid workers were killed in a bombing at the UN headquarters in Baghdad. It's a day to pay tribute to all people affected by humanitarian crises and those who lost their lives in humanitarian service. It's a day to celebrate the spirit that inspires humanitarian work around the world.",
  "column2Copy":"As the world becomes a more and more volatile place, this has never been more important. There is an urgent need to realize a greater sense of responsibility and develop a sense of global community. World Humanitarian Day should inspire action and make it clear that we stand in solidarity against conflict, torture, disease, famine, suffering and the poor leadership that often turns a blind eye. This day is a great opportunity to get involved and do something to help those who need it the most."
